## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area


## Main questions that were answered

My interest was in user_type , member_gender , member_birth_year and trips in terms of time and how did these features decide the answers on the quesions such as :
<ul>
<li>When were most trips taken in terms of time ?</li>
<li>How long did the average trip take?</li>
<li>Did the  most trips depend on user_type or time?</li>
</ul>


## Key Insights for Presentation

<ol>
<li>The distribution of duration in seconds was right-skewed such that the lower duration the more trips.</li>
<li>Although there was slightly positive correlation between age and duration but it didn't mean any thing. As a result i considered that there was no any positive relationship.</li>
<li>We noticed that the females had more trips the whole week days than males while males had very much more duration.</li>
</ol>
